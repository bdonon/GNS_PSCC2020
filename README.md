# GNS_PSCC2020

Code that was used in the development of the paper https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02372741v1

Disclaimer : This code is not maintained, as a more generic version of this work is on the way. 
However, some parts of this code could still be useful to some, so I still decided to put it online.
